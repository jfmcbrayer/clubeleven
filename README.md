# clubeleven

clubeleven is a prototyping workspace for Aardwolf (https://aardwolf.social) written in Python. It is not intended to be used in production, and will *probably** never provide a usable ActivityPub server. It does include experiments and proofs of concept that will be re-implemented in Rust for Aardwolf.

## name

[Club Eleven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Eleven** was a nightclub in mid-20th century London which played a major role in the emergence of bebop jazz in Britain. So this is a jazz (Django) pub (ActivityPub).
